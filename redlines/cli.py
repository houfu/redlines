# Command line interface for redlines.

A command line interface for the redlines library that allows you to compare two strings
and see the differences in the terminal.


## NAME
`redlines` - A command line interface for the redlines library to compare text differences

## SYNOPSIS
```sh
redlines [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] SOURCE TEST
```

## DESCRIPTION
`Redlines` is a command line utility that shows the differences between two strings/text.
The changes are represented with strike-throughs and underlines, similar to Microsoft Word's track changes.
This method of showing changes is more familiar to lawyers and is more compact for long series of characters.

## COMMANDS
```sh
text
```
Compares the strings SOURCE and TEST and produces a redline in the terminal in a display that shows the original, new, and redlined text.

```sh
simple_text
```
Compares the strings SOURCE and TEST and outputs the redline in the terminal.

```sh
markdown
```
Compares the strings SOURCE and TEST and outputs the redline as a markdown.

## OPTIONS
```sh
-h, --help
```
Show this help message and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Compare two strings and display the differences in a detailed layout:
```sh
redlines text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." "The quick brown fox walks past the lazy dog."
```

Compare two strings and output the redline directly:
```sh
redlines simple_text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." "The quick brown fox walks past the lazy dog."
```

## LIMITATIONS
* The `text` command is not able to show more than 6 lines of text. You may want to use `simple_text` for longer text.

You may also want to consider a related textual project if you want to use redlines in the terminal,
[redlines-textual](https://github.com/houfu/redlines-textual).
