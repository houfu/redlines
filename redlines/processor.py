This regular expression matches a group of characters that can include any character except for parentheses
and whitespace characters (which include spaces, tabs, and line breaks) or any character
that is a parenthesis or punctuation mark (.?!-).
The group can also include any whitespace characters that follow these characters.

Breaking it down further:

* `(` and `)` indicate a capturing group
* `(?: )` is a non-capturing group, meaning it matches the pattern but doesn't capture the matched text
* `[^()\s]+` matches one or more characters that are not parentheses or whitespace characters
* `|` indicates an alternative pattern
* `[().?!-]` matches any character that is a parenthesis or punctuation mark `(.?!-)`
* `\s*` matches zero or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, or line breaks) that follow the previous pattern.
