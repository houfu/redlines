# Code of Conduct

All participants in the development of _redlines_, whether online or otherwise,
are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct.

## The Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment,
we pledge to make participation in our project and our community
a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or sexual identity and orientation.

## The Standards

As this library was first written for lawyers, we expect a professional
level of courtesy and respect in our interactions with each other and others.

Being courteous and respectful does not mean that we cannot create a welcoming and inclusive
environment for all, including:

* Participants who may not have legal background and knowledge.
* Participants who may not have background or knowledge in computing, coding or software development.

Examples of behaviour that contributes a positive environment include:

* Respectful and courteous language
* Respecting other's viewpoints and experiences
* Gratefully accepting constructive criticism

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* Discourteous, insulting and frivolous language
* Abuse of process
* Public and private harrassment
* Discussions on politics or any matter which has no relation to this project
* Other conduct which we deem could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Violations of the Code of Conduct may be reported by sending an email
to [houfu@OUTLOOK dot sg](mailto:houfu@outlook.sg).
All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to
the circumstances. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

We hold the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
Conduct,
or to ban temporarily or permanently any members for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.
